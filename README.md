# ui-pattern

This document is a project that I made for a project in my sei immersion class at General Assembly. It involved contacting APIs and fetching information to our own website. This is my first experience working with api's. For this project I contacted the internet Chuck Norris website. This api feeds jokes regarding Chuck Norris and his reputation as an all-powerfull being. The site features a filter that allows one to determine the contact that the site fetches. For this project, I chose the categorie 'nerdy', which provides Chuch Norris humor related to the tech field. Many of the jokes I don't understand because they make obtuse references to coding projects that are above my level. There are some things that could be improved on this website. I hope to improve on many aspects of working with api's in the future.
